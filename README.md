# Tape_to_Tape
Python code for handling data generated with the Tape to Tape tracking app.

I intend to produce code that will generate statistics (player- and team-level) as well as visualizations but the only script presently available (process_game.py) reformats the exported plays file available for any game loaded into the tracking interface at tapetotapetracker.com.
